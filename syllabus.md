# Syllabus

The purpose of this course is for students to learn how to engage in the scientific process using
data-centric concepts and methods and to *think like a data scientist* by critically analyzing their
own work and the work of others.

## Learning Outcomes

It is my goal that after completing this course successfully, you will be able to:

1.	Explore a data set to determine whether and how it might illuminate questions of interest.
2.	Define and operationalize a research question such that a data analysis could produce meaningful knowledge.
3.	Use best practices to carry out analyses in a documented, reproducible, and efficient fashion.
4.	Present the results of a data analysis with appropriate visuals and written argument.
5.	Identify weaknesses in a data analysis and assess their impact on the correctness and utility of the results.
6.	Assess ethical implications of an analysis in terms of both classical human subject research ethics and contemporary concerns such as fairness and bias.
7.	Understand the space of data science techniques and applications, and relate future learning to this framework.

## Resources and Readings

The [Resources page](resources/index.md) on the course web site has a more complete list of resources that I will update throughout the semester.

### Textbook

Our primary textbooks are:

> <cite>Python for Data Analysis</cite> (2nd Edition) by Wes McKinney (O’Reilly, ISBN 978-1491957660)

> <cite>Think Like a Data Scientist</cite> by Brian Godsey (Manning, ISBN 978-1633430273)

Both of these books are available at no cost to ACM members (including ACM student members) through
the ACM's [O'Reilly Learning Platform subscription](https://learning.acm.org/e-learning/oreilly). An
[ACM student membership](https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options) costs $19/year, and
members have access to these books as well as the rest of the O'Reilly Learning Platform, including
most books published by O'Reilly, No Starch, Manning, and several other technical publishers.

If you want a more thorough treatment of the core Python language traditional book format, I recommend:

> <cite>Learn Python the Hard Way</cite> by Zed Shaw

### Online Readings

Throughout the semester, I will assign various readings from the Internet and research papers. These
will be posted to to the course web site.

### Software

We will be using Python with the PyData tools (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.). The
easiest way to install the required software is to install Anaconda Python.  The various Python
libraries we use each have their own documentation.

I will not provide support for debugging Python installations other than Anaconda (and other Conda
distributions, like miniconda and miniforge).

Further information about software, and links to documentation, can be found in the
[course resources](./resources/index.md).

## Course Structure

This class uses a flipped-classroom design.  I will primarily not be lecturing in class; instead,
content delivery is asynchronous through the following resources:

-   Video lectures
-   Accompanying notes (on the course web site)
-   The textbook
-   Other readings linked from the lecture notes and course web page

Each week has approximately 75–90 minutes of video material, plus some reading.  There will be a
short quiz before each Thursday's class as an initial check on your understanding of the material.
Weeks with exams will have lower video and reading loads.

Our in-person class time will be for discussing the course material and topics, additional
mini-lectures to supplement your understanding of the course, and team-based exercises to practice
the material with ready access to peer and instructor support.

Putting these together, along with the larger assignments, results in the following components of
the class:

-   Reading and study
-   Work in class
-   Assignments
-   Exams (in-class)

### Grading

Your final grade will be computed from the course components as follows:

| Category           | %   |
| ------------------ | :-: |
| In-Class Work      | 10% |
| Individual Quizzes | 10% |
| Team Quizzes       | 10% |
| Assignments        | 40% |
| Exams              | 20% |
| Final              | 10% |

The standard 70/80/90 scale determines the *minimum* grade you will receive (that is, if you have 80
total course points, you will receive at least a B-).

### Class Sessions

I expect you to actively participate in our class sessions.  Since these are interactive working
sessions, if you have a laptop please bring it to class.

The in-person class sessions are based on the principles of team-based learning, adapted to this
class's needs and role in the graduate curriculum.  You will be working with a group of your peers
throughout the semester helping each other practice the material, discuss and apply it to small
exercises and examples, and identify places where you need and want to learn more.

On **Thursdays**, our class will look like a “normal” team-based learning class — a team quiz (the
*Readiness Assessment Process*), supplementary content discussion as needed, and an application
exercise.  The TBL readiness assessment process normally consists of two parts: an individual quiz,
followed by re-taking the quiz as a team to discuss and improve your answers.  In this class, we
will be implementing that with an online individual quiz due before class and an in-person team
quiz (see [Quizzes](#quizzes)).

**Tuesdays** will be more varied.  The first Tuesday will be the class introduction and overview,
and our exams will be on Tuesdays.  On weeks when an assignment is due (see the
[schedule](schedule.md)), we will use the class period for collaborative problem-solving about the
assignment.  Other Tuesdays will be for more extended discussion and application exercises depending
on where we are in the semester.

In-class work will contribute to your grade.

One final note on classes: taking care of our health, individually and as a class, is top priority.
While I aim for every class to be a meaningful, can't-miss learning experience, I also want us to
have a general expectation that if we're ill, we stay home, both to recover ourselves and to protect
our colleagues' health.  I've designed the grading policies to help with this (see
[Coronavirus](#coronavirus)), but if we need to further adjust to accommodate the semester's health
demands, we will.  If you need to miss class, I encourage you to phone in and have a teammate put
you on speakerphone during your team's activities, if you are feeling well enough; this will allow
you to contribute to the team quiz and work.

### Quizzes

There is a short weekly **individual quiz** in Canvas, due before class on Thursday (at 8AM, so I
can look at results before class), on the readings and videos.  The purpose of these quizzes is to
help make sure you are prepared for applying the material, and to give both you and I early and
frequent checks on your understanding.

In class on Thursdays, we will take the **team quiz**, which will usually be the same or very
similar as the individual quiz.  This is an opportunity to refine your understanding of the material
and collaboratively fill in gaps you may have missed.  Individual and team quizzes are weighted
equally in your final grade.

For both individual and team quizzes, only the 10 highest scores will contribute to your grade.

### Assignments

There will be 8 homework assignments practicing data science techniques in Python. Each assignment
is due at **midnight on Sunday** of the week in which it is due.

I have scheduled this due date to give you the weekend to finish the assignment if that works best
with your schedule. However, as documented above, I do not commit to checking Piazza on the weekends
to watch my time, and therefore you should work on the assignment early enough that you can raise
questions and have them resolved before the weekend is over.

The first assignment (A0) is a warm-up assignment to make sure that you can install the software and
run Python notebooks. You must complete this assignment individually.

The other assignments (A1–7) are full assignments doing data science with Python. You may do up to
**3** of these assignments with a partner, and must complete 4 individually. You may choose which
assignments you solo and which are a group effort. When doing an assignment with a partner, submit
one copy for both of you, and indicate your partner's name in the Blackboard submission comments.

I will drop the lowest assignment grade.

### Exams and Final

There will be two midterm exams and a final.  

There will be a makeup exam available the last week of class. If you turn in the makeup exam, your
grade on it will **replace** your lowest normal exam grade.

## Course Policies

Our work within this structure is governed by the following policies, in addition to applicable
university policies and regulations and general principles of academic and scholarly integrity.

### Web Site and Announcements

I will use Piazza for all course communication, including announcements. Please make sure your
Piazza notifications are set correctly, so that you are notified of important announcements.

I will sometimes need to update assignments after I have issued them. When this is necessary, I will
include a revision log at the top of the assignment describing the changes, and will make a course
announcement regarding the change.  I will also state whether the revision changes a requirement
(this is rare), or clarifies a requirement.

### Late Work

For the assignments, you have a budget of 4 late days to use throughout the semester, at your
discretion. Each late day extends an assignment deadline by 24 hours with no penalty; late days are
indivisible, so submitting an assignment 12 hours late requires an entire late day. You may use up
to 3 late days on a single assignment.[^1]  When submitting an assignment using a late day, state
with your submission the number of days you are using.  I appreciate it if you notify the TA and I
(via a Piazza private message) prior to the deadline that you are planning to submit late, but do
not require you to do so.

[^1]: The purpose of this rule is so that we can discuss assignment solutions on Thursday after they
are due.

This policy, combined with dropping the lowest assignment grade, is designed to accommodate most
ordinary need for extensions or late submissions. Therefore, exceptions beyond this policy will not
generally be granted; any requests for individual exceptions must be submitted in writing (by e-mail
or Piazza) so that I have a record of the request and my response.

Exams will be at the published times.  The makeup exam is the ordinary accommodation for not being
able to take the exam when scheduled.

### Cheating and Academic Integrity

As both a scientist and a student, you are expected to do your own work, attribute sources, and
respect the legal and moral rights of others with respect to their work; as a student, you are also
required to abide by the Boise State University Student Code of Conduct. While I aim to allow you to
make reasonable use of resources, cheating (including copying code, using unauthorized resources
during tests, etc.) is not ok. If you are found to be cheating, the penalty may range from an F on
the assignment to an F on the course and will generally be reported to the university.

### Conduct

I expect you to behave in a civil, respectful manner in all class interactions and to contribute to
a constructive learning environment.

The [Recurse Center Social Rules](https://recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) are a good source
of guidance on how to maintain a constructive and educational environment.

If you experience or witness harassment of any form, please let me know.

### Disability Accommodations

If you need particular accommodations or support to be able to fully participate in this course,
please talk with me as soon as possible by e-mail or in office hours.  If you have documentation
from Disability Services authorizing specific accommodations, please bring it; however, a documented
disability is not necessary for me to be willing to talk with you about how to make the course work
for you.

## Coronavirus

While we are partly back to “normal”, this semester is difficult, with an unknown set of risks
hanging over us and massive disruption in our work, study, and outside lives. I have designed the
content, assessment plan, and policies of this class to try to be as flexible and accommodating of
the various pressures and difficulties as possible while providing our intended learning outcomes.
If there are things that are not working, or challenges arise that affect how you can engage with
the class, please let me know — I want to make this work for you.

One specific risk is that one of you (or I) contract COVID-19 or another serious illness during the
semester.  I hope this does not happen to any of us, but I have attempted to account for this risk
by setting the design parameter that you should be able to miss two full weeks of the semester (or
perhaps even three) with minimal impact on learning outcomes and grades, possibly with the need to
do some catch-up work. The following policies are specifically designed to accommodate this:

- Asynchronous content delivery through video lectures and readings, so you can watch them at your
  convenience and catch up with course content later.
- Dropping the lowest assignment score, so you can miss an entire assignment window with no effect
  on grade.  If you need to do this, I encourage you to still do the missed assignment for your own
  study purposes, but you can do that on a timetable that works with your schedule and health needs.
- Grading in-class work and quizzes on 10 out of 15 weeks.
- A makeup exam to replace your lowest midterm grade, so you can miss a midterm and compensate with
  the makeup.

If you need to miss more than 2–3 weeks of class due to illness, it is likely that you will need to
take an incomplete on the course. I am happy to work with you on this if it becomes necessary.

While COVID-19 is the direct impetus for much of this design, these class features are not limited
to that specific illness.  I want us to take care of our own and each others' health, which may
include staying home from class, and while doing so will result in missed practice and discussion
(and the design of in-class activities is not amenable to recording), I am designing the grading
policies to avoid formal penalties for taking care of yourself.

**Communication** will be the key to making this semester work. I welcome your feedback in general,
and particularly around things that are or are not working for the course structure, both generally
and for your particular situation.
