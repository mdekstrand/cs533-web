## Python and Data

These notebooks are on basic Python data manipulation:

1. [Fun with Numbers](FunWithNumbers.ipynb)
2. [Writing and Using Functions](Functions.ipynb)
3. [Selecting Data](Selection.ipynb)
4. [Reshaping Data](Reshaping.ipynb)
5. [Building Data](BuildingData.ipynb) — building up arrays and data series
6. [Indexing](Indexing.ipynb)
7. [Missing Data](MissingData.ipynb)
8. [Tricks with Boolean Series](BooleanSeries.ipynb)

## Visualization

1. [Drawing Charts](Charting.ipynb)
2. [Movie Score Charting Examples](CriticScores.ipynb) — example charts used in several videos in {module}`week3`
3. [Chart Finishing Touches](ChartFinishingTouches.ipynb)

## Probability and Statistics

1.  [Penguin Inference](PenguinSamples.ipynb) (from {module}`week4`)
2.  [Empirical Probabilities](EmpiricalProbabilities.ipynb) (demonstration of using boolean series to compute probabilities with empirical data)
3.  [Probability Distributions](Distributions.ipynb) (from {module}`week4`)
4.  [Sampling Distributions](SamplingDists.ipynb) (from {module}`week4`)
5.  [One Sample T-test and Distribution Comparison](OneSample.ipynb)
6.  [Correlation](Correlation.ipynb)
7.  [Regressions](Regressions.ipynb) (goes with [Week 8](../../week8/index.md))
8.  [Logistic Regression](LogitRegressionDemo.ipynb)

## SciKit-Learn and ML Models

1.  [SciKit-Learn Logistic Regression](SciKitLogistic.ipynb)
2.  [SciKit-Learn Pipelines and Regularization](SciKitPipeline.ipynb) — also includes a significance test
3.  [Advanced SciKit-Learn pipeline and logistic regression example](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-classifier-on-census-income-data-e1dbef0b5738) (on Towards Data Science)
4.  [Movie Decomposition](MovieDecomp.ipynb)
5.  [K-Means Example](ClusteringExample.ipynb) (uses the chi-papers data from [Week 13](../../week13/index.md#practice))
6.  [Tuning Hyperparameters](TuningExample.ipynb)

## Specific Data Set Examples

These are more advanced examples of data manipulation and collection:

1.  [MovieLens Time Series](MLTimeSeries.ipynb)
2.  [Sessionization](Sessions.ipynb) (demonstrates some more advanced aggregation and time-based operations)
3.  [Fetching CHI Papers](FetchCHIPapers.ipynb) creates the `chi-papers.csv` file from Internet sources

## Workflow Example

This example demonstrates a complete Git-based workflow:
