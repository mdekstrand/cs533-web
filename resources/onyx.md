# Remotely Using Onyx

If you want to use Jupyter notebooks on Onyx nodes, there are a few extra steps you need to do.
There is a video at the end of this page walking through the process.

## Install Anaconda

Connect to the Onyx head node.  From the command line, run:

    $ ssh username@onyx.boisestate.edu

On Windows, you can use MobaXterm.

Follow the instructions in [Software Installation](software.md#onyx) to install the software.
I recommend accepting all defaults, which will set up your shell to automatically activate Conda next time you log in.
Due to network file system performance, I recommend using Miniconda instead of the full Anaconda platform, so we only install the packages we need.

Log out of Onyx.

## Preparing Off-Campus Access

Directly connecting to `onyx.boisestate.edu` — called the ‘head node’ — is fine for transferring
files, installing the software, and other light work, but not for substantial computing. For
actually doing work, we need to connect to one of the ‘Onyx nodes’, individual computers in the
Boise State CS department computing system. These computers are numbered with 2–3 digit numbers and
have names like `onyxnode03.boisestate.edu`.

Only the Onyx head node accepts connections from outside the Boise State network. To connect to one
of the normal Onyx nodes, you need to be on the Boise State network. There are a few ways to do this
from the outside.

### OpenSSH ProxyJump

Set up SSH to use `onyx.boisestate.edu` a ‘jump host’ (sometimes called a ‘bastion host’).
OpenSSH has direct support for jump hosts, and this is probably the easiest way to set things up on macOS and Linux.
Recent versions of Windows (20H2 and later) also include OpenSSH with support for jump hosts as an optional package.

If the directory `~/.ssh` (a directory named `.ssh` in your home directory) does not yet exist, create it:

    mkdir ~/.ssh

To set up jump host connections, modify the file `~/.ssh/config` (the file `config` in the `.ssh`
subdirectory of your home directory) to contain the following lines:

    Host onyxnode*.boisestate.edu
        User username
        ProxyJump onyx.boisestate.edu
    
    Host onyx.boisestate.edu
        User username
    
If the file does not yet exist, create it. The `User` lines make SSH automatically fill in your
username when you connect to Onyx in the future, so it's more convenient to connect.

### MobaXterm

[MobaXterm]: https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/

The [MobaXterm][] SSH client for Windows includes built-in support for jump hosts.  Unfortunately,
you will need to create a new session profile for each Onyx node you try to connect to.

To use a jump host, in the MobaXterm “Session” window, under “Network Settings”, click “SSH gateway”.
In the window that opens, enter your Onyx connection information: the host `onyx.boisestate.edu`, and
your Boise State username.

Then, when you connect with this profile, it will use `onyx.boisestate.edu` as your jump host and
allow you to directly connect to an Onyx node.

### Boise State VPN

You can also use the [Boise State VPN](https://bsuvpn-offcampus.boisestate.edu/).
For this, you will need to set up [Duo Security](https://www.boisestate.edu/oit-accounts/multi-factor-authentication-duo/) for the two-factor authentication.
I have requested VPN access for all students in the class.

## Connecting to Nodes

On Linux and macOS, once you on the university network (either physically or by VPN) or have set up
your jump host, you can connect to a node from a terminal:

    $ ssh onyxnode03.boisestate.edu

If you are using `ProxyJump`, SSH will prompt you for your password twice — once to set up the
proxy, and again to log in.

On Windows with MobaXterm, enter the node name as the host to connect to when creating a new SSH
session.

Once you are logged in to a node, you can run `uptime` to see how heavily-loaded it is, and `w` to
see if anyone else is logged in. An idle node will have a load average of close to 0 when you run
`uptime`.

If the node is in use, log out and try a different node. Consult the beginning-of-the-year e-mail
from Ben for a list of available nodes.

All nodes (and the head node) share the same home directory, so your files will be available no
matter which node you use.

## Using Jupyter

Once you have logged into the Onyx node you want to use, change into the directory where you're keeping your class files or the specific project you want to work on and start the notebook server:

    $ cd CS533/project-dir
    $ jupyter notebook --no-browser

The `--no-browser` option is to keep Jupyter from trying to start a browser; if you're logged in through MobaXterm, it usually sets up X11 forwarding, and without this option Jupyter will start Firefox on the Onyx node and try to display it on your computer.
It will be much more efficient to use Jupyter's network interface than to tunnel an entire browser over remote display.

The notebook server will print out some log messages; at the bottom you will see something like

```
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=9539c85b91af17bb3fc3d5a4f71b113874af33d6b5c6d245
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=9539c85b91af17bb3fc3d5a4f71b113874af33d6b5c6d245
```

You now need to set up an **SSH tunnel** to connect to the server.
Note the *port number* from the URL (the numbers after `localhost:`, in this case 8888).
Create an SSH tunnel that tunnels that port from your local computer to the port on your node.
From the command line, you can do this by opening another terminal and running:

    ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 onyxnode03.boisestate.edu

This tunnels port 8888 from your local computer to the same port on `localhost` on the remote
computer (the Onyx node). You need to change 8888 and `onyxnode03` to match your port number and
Onyx node.

```{admonition} Direct MobaXterm Tunnel
:class: dropdown
If you are using MobaXterm directly with the VPN, use the *Tunneling* tool in the toolbar (if you are using MobaXterm as a command-line terminal to run the `ssh` command, this will not work; instead use the command-line instructions).
Create a new tunnel with the following settings:

- Forwarded port: port number (e.g. 8888)
- SSH server: the node (e.g. `onxnode03.boisestate.edu`)
- SSH login: your username
- SSH port: 22
- Remote server: `localhost`
- Remote port: port number (e.g. 8888)
```

The forwarded port (in `ssh -L`, the first port number) does not have to match the remote port.
If you have something else running on your computer using port 888, you can forward any port you want.

Once you have the port forward or tunnel set up, go to the URL indicated in the Jupyter Notebook output in your web browser.
The tunnel makes `localhost:8888` on your computer route to `localhost:8888` on the Onyx node, and everything works.
