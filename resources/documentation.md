## Writing

Writing is a part of this class, but will play a particularly important role in your graduate career.
Hopefully these resources are helpful:

-   [<cite>Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace</cite>](https://boisestate.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/919068263) — one of the best books I know to help you improve your writing.
