The materials for this course are an **open educational resource**.  Unless otherwise noted in a
specific page or resource, all content with the exception of the assignments is made available under
the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License][BY-SA].  This
means that you can reuse, adapt, and remix the content, so long as you (1) properly attribute the

You may freely use small snippets of my example code in work under any license; I would appreciate

## Assignments and Solutions

The assignments are not open-licensed.  Students in my class are authorized to use them for the
purpose of studying in the course and preparing their solutions to the assignments; I further grant
permission to retain copies of the assignments, student solutions, and my own solutions that I
provide through private class channels indefinitely, but **not** to redistribute those solutions.

The principles of academic integrity, and for Boise State University students, the Student Code of
Conduct ([Policy 2020](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/)) prohibit
publishing solutions to the assignments, such as posting them to a web site or committing them to a
public GitHub repository.  To the extent that an assignment solution is a derived work of my
assignment description, such publication is also a violation of my copyright.  I encourage you to
use git and, if you like, GitHub for your course work; please just keep it in a private repository.

## Teaching with These Resources

If you are an instructor looking to adapt this material and would like access to the video source
materials (raw captures, Camtasia project files, and slide decks), please contact me.  I am also
interested in sharing and collaborating on the in-class exercises that are not a part of the public
course materials.

I'm also happy to grant permission to reuse my assignments in your course — contact me for details
and written permission.
