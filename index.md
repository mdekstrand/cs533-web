# CS 533 Homepage

Welcome to CS 533, *Introduction to Data Science*, for Fall 2022.

:::{updated} F22

The CS 533 updates for Fall 2022 are a work in progress. Feel free to peruse the
site, but it is definitely not final right now.
:::

This web site is the central information point for the class, where I will be distributing the course materials, including lecture videos.

Points of interest include:

*  The [syllabus](syllabus/index)
*  {{LMS}} (for grades and submitting assignments)
*  {module}`week0` — start here!

I ask that you direct **all course questions** through Piazza, even if the question is just to me.
This will help me ensure that I do not miss any questions or concerns.

## Site Feedback

There are several ways to provide feedback on this course content and site itself:

- For students, comment in Piazza
- Use the GitHub menu at the top of the site and “open issue” or “suggest edit”
- Make a comment on the page. Note that these comments are all public and are stored in GitHub Issues.
  I recommend using comments primarily for tips for your subsequent readers.
