    "This is the 0th assignment for CS 533, *Introduction to Data Science*.  It is due **Sunday, Aug. 30, at 11:59 pm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to make sure that you can run Python notebooks and successfully submit an assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the following in mind for **all** notebooks you develop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure your notebook. Use headings with meaningful levels in Markdown cells, and explain the questions each piece of code is to answer or the reason it is there.\n",
    "2. Make sure your notebook can always be rerun from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, I am actually giving you the answers - the PDF accompanying this assignment contains the code to enter in each of the cells below.  I want you to work through the process of entering, running, and submitting code before you need to worry about how to write it, so we can focus on learning one thing at a time. For the next assignment, when you need to write your own code, you've already been through the mechanics."
