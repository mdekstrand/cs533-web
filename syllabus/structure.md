# Course Structure

:::{updated} F22
:::

This class uses a flipped-classroom design.  I will primarily not be lecturing in class; instead,
content delivery is asynchronous through the following resources:

-   Video lectures
-   Accompanying notes (on the course web site)
-   The textbook
-   Other readings linked from the lecture notes and course web page

Each week has approximately 75–90 minutes of video material, plus some reading.
There will be a short quiz before each Thursday's class as an initial check on
your understanding of the material. Weeks with exams will have lower video and
reading loads.  You are expected to watch and read the material on your own
time.

Our synchronous class time will be for discussing the course material and
topics, additional mini-lectures to supplement your understanding of the course,
and team-based exercises to practice the material with ready access to peer and
instructor support.

Putting these together, along with the larger assignments, results in the
following components of the class:

-   Reading and study
-   Work in class
-   Assignments
-   Exams (in-class)

## Grading

Your final grade will be computed from the course components as follows:

| Category           | %   |
| ------------------ | :-: |
| In-Class Work      | 10% |
| Individual Quizzes | 5%  |
| Team Quizzes       | 5%  |
| Assignments        | 50% |
| Exams              | 20% |
| Final              | 10% |

The standard 70/80/90 scale determines the *minimum* grade you will receive (that is, if you have 80
total course points, you will receive at least a B-).

## Class Meetings

I expect you to actively participate in our synchronous class meetings.  Since
these are interactive working sessions, if you have a laptop please bring it to
class when we meet in-person.

Synchronous class meetings, whether in-person or remote, are based on the
principles of team-based learning, adapted to this class's needs and role in the
graduate curriculum.  You will be working with a group of your peers throughout
the semester helping each other practice the material, discuss and apply it to
small exercises and examples, and identify places where you need and want to
learn more.

On **Thursdays**, our class will look like a “normal” team-based learning class
— a team quiz (the *Readiness Assessment Process*), supplementary content
discussion as needed, and an application exercise.  The TBL readiness assessment
process normally consists of two parts: an individual quiz, followed by
re-taking the quiz as a team to discuss and improve your answers.  In this
class, we will be implementing that with an online individual quiz due before
class and a synchronous team quiz (see [Quizzes](#quizzes)). Thursday class
activities will contribute to your grade.

Approximately half of the Thursday meetings will be remote via Zoom, and half of
them in-person.  See the [course schedule](../schedule.md) for the schedule of
in-person vs. remote course meetings.

On **Tuesdays**, I will be logged in to Zoom during the normal class time for
open discussion and Q&A on the course material, assignments, etc.  On weeks when
an assignment is due (see the [schedule](../schedule.md)), we will also use the
class period for collaborative problem-solving about the assignment.

One final note on classes: taking care of our health, individually and as a
class, is top priority. While I aim for every class to be a meaningful,
can't-miss learning experience, I also want us to have a general expectation
that if we're ill, we stay home, both to recover ourselves and to protect our
colleagues' health.  I've designed the grading policies to help with this (see
[Coronavirus](#coronavirus)), but if we need to further adjust to accommodate
the semester's health demands, we will.  If you need to miss class, I encourage
you to phone in and have a teammate put you on speakerphone during your team's
activities, if you are feeling well enough; this will allow you to contribute to
the team quiz and work.  We'll adapt as we need throughout the semester to
ensure everyone can participate.

## Quizzes

There is a short weekly **individual quiz** in {{LMS}}, due before class on Thursday (at 8AM, so I
can look at results before class), on the readings and videos.  The purpose of these quizzes is to
help make sure you are prepared for applying the material, and to give both you and I early and
frequent checks on your understanding.

In class on Thursdays, we will take the **team quiz**, which will usually be the same or very
similar as the individual quiz.  This is an opportunity to refine your understanding of the material
and collaboratively fill in gaps you may have missed.  Individual and team quizzes are weighted
equally in your final grade.

For both individual and team quizzes, only the 10 highest scores will contribute to your grade.

## Assignments

There will be 8 homework assignments practicing data science techniques in Python. Each assignment
is due at **midnight on Sunday** of the week in which it is due.

I have scheduled this due date to give you the weekend to finish the assignment if that works best
with your schedule. However, as documented above, I do not commit to checking Piazza on the weekends
to watch my time, and therefore you should work on the assignment early enough that you can raise
questions and have them resolved before the weekend is over.

The first assignment (A0) is a warm-up assignment to make sure that you can install the software and
run Python notebooks. You must complete this assignment individually.

The other assignments (A1–7) are full assignments doing data science with Python. You may do up to
**3** of these assignments with a partner, and must complete 4 individually. You may choose which
assignments you solo and which are a group effort. When doing an assignment with a partner, submit
one copy for both of you, and indicate your partner's name in the {{LMS}} submission comments.

I will drop the lowest assignment grade.

## Exams and Final

There will be two midterm exams and a final.

There will be a makeup exam available the last week of class. If you turn in the
makeup exam, your grade on it will **replace** your lowest normal exam grade.

All exams will be on Canvas.  Each exam will be available for 72 hours from the
time it is released. I will release midterms at midnight on Wednesday, so they
are due by midnight on Saturday; the final will be released at noon on Monday of
finals week and due at noon on Thursday.

Once you begin an exam, you will have 4 hours to complete a midterm or 6 hours
to complete the final.  If you have technical or other problems that keep you
from finishing it before the timeout, please let me know by Piazza private
message to reset it.  The deadline takes precedence over the timeout; if you
begin the final at 11:00AM on Thursday, your completed final is still due at
noon, not at 5 PM.

Exams will have a data analysis component and a conceptual component. The
conceptual component will include a range of different question types, including
short-answer, multiple choice, and matching.
