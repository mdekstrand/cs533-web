# Week 11 — More Modeling ({date}`wk11 range`)

:::{updated} F22
:::

In this week, we're going to learn more about model building, that will be useful in Assignment 5:

- Feature engineering
- SciKit-Learn pipelines and workflows
- Regularization
- Analyzing model results

## {{mdoc}} SciKit Learn Pipelines

Read the [SciKit-Learn User Guide chapter on pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html).

## {{mdoc}} SciKit Learn Preprocessing

Read the [SciKit-Learn User Guide chapter on pre-processing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).

## {{mvideo}} Regularization

This video introduces regularization: ridge regression, lasso regression, and the elasticnet.
Lasso regression can help with (semi-)automatic feature selection.

## {{mnotebook}} Pipeline and Regularization

[This notebook](../resources/tutorials/SciKitPipeline.ipynb) demonstrates pipelines and $L_2$ regression, and performs a significance test of classifier improvement.

It also shows a training of a decision tree (next video).

## {{mnotebook}} Advanced Pipelines

The [Advanced Pipelines notebook](../resources/tutorials/AdvancedPipeline.ipynb) demonstrates a much more advanced SciKit-Learn pipeline.

## {{mvideo}} Models and Depth

What does the world look like beyond logistic regression?
Can a model output be a feature?

How do we understand, *robustly*, the performance of our system?
What contributes to its performance?

## {{mdoc}} Statistical Significance Tests

:::{reading}
:title: Statistical Significance Tests for Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms

:length: 3400 words
:::

Read [Statistical Significance Tests for Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-significance-tests-for-comparing-machine-learning-algorithms/).

:::{note}
In the Week 9 activity, we used the paired *t*-test for comparing the output of two regression models.
Our use of this test did **not** violate the guidance in this reading — why is that?
