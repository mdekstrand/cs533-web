# Assignment 0

The first assignment is to make sure that you can successfully run code and submit results.

It is due **August 30, 2020** at midnight.

## Revision Log

Aug. 24, 2020
:   Added notes about the required Conda packages.

## Prerequisites

-   Conda installation (either Anaconda or Miniconda)
-   The following Conda packages (install with `conda install`):

    -   `pandas`
    -   `seaborn`    

## Instructions

The steps of this assignment:

1. Download the [starter notebook](A0-Notebook/A0-Notebook.ipynb){: download="A0.ipynb"} ([online view](A0-Notebook.ipynb)).
2. Download the [code PDF](A0-Solution.pdf).
3. Start Jupyter and open the notebook.
3. Fill in the code in the notebook, running each cell.
4. Print the notebook to a PDF file.  To do this, go to “File” and pick “Print Preview” *within Jupyter*, then print the resulting page to PDF.  If you just print the notebook to a PDF without going through Jupyter's print preview, it won't look as good.
5. Submit the notebook (`.ipynb` file) and PDF printout to Blackboard.

See [Our First Python Notebook](../../content/week1/index.md#first-notebook) for a video overview of the submission process.

Before you start the assigment, you will need to [install the software](../../resources/software.md).
If you are using Onyx, see the [Onyx instructions](../../resources/onyx.md).

## Preparing a PDF File

As shown in [the First Notebook video](../../content/week1/index.md#first-notebook), use the following steps to create your PDF file:

1.  Go to ‘File’ → ‘Print Preview’ *in Jupyter* (not your web browser)
2.  Print the Jupyter print preview to a PDF file using your browser's “Print to PDF” feature.

## Resources

- [Starter notebook](A0-Notebook.ipynb) ([download](A0-Notebook/A0-Notebook.ipynb){: download="A0.ipynb"})
- [PDF with code](A0-Solution.pdf)
